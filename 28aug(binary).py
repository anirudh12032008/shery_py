# decimal to binary
# ex:- 34 
# step 1:- divide by 2 and write the remainder
# no.    quotient    remainder
# 34        17          0
# 17        8           1
# 8         4           0
# 4         2           0
# 2         1           0
# 1         0           1
# step 2:- reverse the order 



# binary to decimal
# ex 100010 ie 34
# step 1 :- write the digits and then below them power of 2 from 0 to the number
# step 2:- multiply them and then add
#   1      0     0     0     1     0
#   2^5   2^4   2^3   2^2   2^1   2^0 
#    32     0   0       0    2      0 = 34
#   Easy :sob:
