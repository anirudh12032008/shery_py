39) Print  List elements in reverse order
40) Print positive and negative elements of an List
41) Print list in ascending or descending order
42) Accept size n from user and create a n size List then take n inputs into the and finally 
   Print the sum of all elements in the List in the following manner
   10 + 20 + 30 = 60
43) Mean of List elements.
44) Find the greatest element and print its index too.
   {2, 96, 69, 77, 145, 20} = Max element = 145 found at 4 index
45) Find the smallest element and print its index too.
   {2, 96, 69, 77, 145, 20} = Min element = 2 found at 0 index
46) Find the second greatest element 
   {2, 96, 69, 77, 145, 20} = Second greatest element = 96
47) Check if List is sorted or not.
