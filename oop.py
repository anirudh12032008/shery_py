# OOP
# 5 pillars
# 1. Encaptulation - storing in a scope for security
# 2. Inheritance - obtaining something from a higher scope as default
# 3. Polymorphism(object) - many forms ex- amphibiens(frog)
# 4. Abstraction - give user only the intrested things
# 5. Data hiding - keeps some code secret to prevent security breech


# method vs function --> methods always return something

# class attribute/ variable / member  ---> independent of objects
# object attribute/ variable / member
# same for class methods and object methods



# getter setter deleter
